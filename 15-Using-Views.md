Using Views
===========

TODO: Move related sections of the CrashCourse here.

TODO: Add examples from the examples directories and explain them.

TODO: Talk about how Express 3.x uses async views; list sync (Jade, ..) vs async engines; explain how to use each type of engine the best way with ZappaJS; show the difference between e.g. how Jade does `include` and how ZappaJS' backward-compatible `layout` works.
