Introduction
============

Project History
---------------

[ZappaJS](http://zappajs.github.com/zappajs/) was conceived by [Maurice Machado](https://github.com/mauricemach) in October 2010. Version 0.3.x used Express 2.x.

Maurice Machado mysteriously disappeared (at least from github) in late 2011, and St√©phane Alnet took over the project and moved it to its current location.

ZappaJS currently supports the latest versions of Express and Socket.IO and is actively maintained.
